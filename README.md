# Travel_App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This application uses Firebase and SqLite local database as backend. 
This application is state managed using Getx state management. 
This application is a travel application that can document where the user has traveled around the world. 
The most interesting feature is that he will get a stamp from the country he has visited which he can use.
